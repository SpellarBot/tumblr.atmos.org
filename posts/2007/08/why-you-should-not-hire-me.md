why you should not hire me
==========================

Rick: so I'm sitting here going through all this paper that was in
folders for a year+ in "my desk" (I just piled up anything that looked
like it might be personal or sensitive into my backpack, and left the
rest of the shit in a pile on a chair), and I find the folders I had for
employment stuff for you and vinbarnes when you were first hired me:
HAHAHAHA. pwnd Rick: and the 3 letters of reference for you were pretty
priceless. they were all glowing except Rick: one of them said
"weaknesses: he dresses like a college student" Rick: and the other said
"weaknesses: a bit geeky"
