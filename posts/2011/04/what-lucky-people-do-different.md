What Lucky People Do Different
==============================

[http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/what-lucky-people-do-differently/](http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/what-lucky-people-do-differently/)

“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool that I’ve
ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost
everything—all external expectations all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of
death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to
follow your heart.”
