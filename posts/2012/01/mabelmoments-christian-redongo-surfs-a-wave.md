title: mabelmoments:

Christian Redongo surfs a wave with a rainbow in the background, in Teahupoo, Tahiti, French Polynesia. This award-winning picture shows land and sea linked by a rainbow. The surfer may have been left wondering whether a pot of gold could be under his board at the bottom of the ocean. 26-year-old photographer, Zak Noyle from Honolulu, Hawaii, scooped the Surfer Magazine 2011 best photo of the year competition for this picture.
