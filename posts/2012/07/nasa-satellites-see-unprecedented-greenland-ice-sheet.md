NASA - Satellites See Unprecedented Greenland Ice Sheet Surface Melt
====================================================================

For several days this month, Greenlandâ€™s surface ice cover melted over a
larger area than at any time in more than 30 years of satellite
observations. Nearly the entire ice cover of Greenland, from its thin,
low-lying coastal edges to its two-mile-thick center, experienced some
degree of melting at its surface, according to measurements from three
independent satellites analyzed by NASA and university scientists.
