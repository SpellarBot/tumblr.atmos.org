collaboration is easier when folks test
=======================================

zenspider: I need help with renderer code. specifically, I can find no
examples of layouts being done with builder and I don't see how it can
even work at this stage. zenspider: I think I am active in the wrong
timezone for these devs :( lantins: not looked into builder/layouts
myself unfortunatly, just use a haml layout myself lantins: but as for
the dev' and other helpful chaps, i think a few are either night owls or
in the states etc ;-) so just hang tight zenspider: heh. k zenspider:
http://rafb.net/p/up52g650.html is what I've got so far...
test\_with\_layout fails because the body is never there. zenspider: I
gotta run for a bit, but I'll be back. I'd appreciate some eyeballs on
that if possible syd: just in time for beer o'clock atmos: zenspider:
i'd suggest haml over builder atmos: hit me up when you'r eback and i
can help you test it atmos: zenspider:
https://gist.github.com/514c2cb5e3de13471f82 zenspider: atmos: here
zenspider: looking atmos: i had to read the tagz docs but the real
difference is tagz \<\< in the layout zenspider: atmos: is the
in-file-templates actually necessary? atmos: shouldn't be zenspider: not
that I mind at this point... atmos: process of elimination zenspider:
bing zenspider: tests pass. rad. thank you! atmos: sweet
