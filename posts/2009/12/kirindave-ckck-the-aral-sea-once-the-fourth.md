The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest inland body of water, has been disappearing since the 60s, after the Soviet Union started using its water sources to irrigate crops. It is now less than 10% of the size it was 50 years ago, and the southern portion continues to shrink (no effort is being made to save it).
A grand monument to the foolishness of the human race.
