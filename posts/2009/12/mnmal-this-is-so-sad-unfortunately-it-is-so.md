This is so sad. Unfortunately it is so true.
It applies not only to social networks, but to websites and blogs in general. Take Lifehacker for example: Their website use to be clean, simple and easy to navigate. Now… Well. it’s mainly advertisement.
I love Lifehacker. They still have some of the best content out there but it’s really really annoying to try to find something there and you are constantly being assaulted by ads.
