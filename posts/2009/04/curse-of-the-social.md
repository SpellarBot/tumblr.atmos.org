Curse of the Social
===================

[unalone](http://unalone.tumblr.com/post/97604367/curse-of-the-social):

> The Internet is subject to a similar set of flaws as any free market
> system. Creations benefit the most from constantly holding the user’s
> attention. If a web site is ad-driven, it wants as many impressions
> and therefore clicks as possible. The result of this is that everybody
> eventually discovers that the more social something is designed to be,
> the more active users it gets.
>
> That’s a good thing, in some situations. There’s nothing bad about
> forming a community, and there’s nothing inherently wrong with wanting
> users to form relationships with one another. The problem is that
> social design sometimes takes away from the intent of a web site. In
> some cases, social elements are malicious: they force users to spend
> more times doing things than they want to spend time on.
>
> A terrific example is World of Warcraft, which essentially forces
> players to join guilds and become part of a system larger than
> themselves. No guild means you can’t easily partake in the more
> difficult and rewarding quests. Essentially, users are penalized for
> trying to do their own thing. When you play World of Warcraft, there
> is always a pressure to work with other people, and of course after
> that the problem replicates itself. Once you’re working with other
> people, there’s a pressure on you to be part of this group, and so
> you’re more likely to continue playing World of Warcraft, and the more
> you play the more incentive you have to stay, and so you are entwined
> in a system that is essentially meaningless. There’s no greater motive
> to playing World of Warcraft than being part of this system; once
> you’re in, you’re given a reason not to get out.
>
> Web sites have this problem as well. Digg has moved itself further and
> further into this concept of itself as a social web site; the further
> it goes, the more power is delegated to a very few users, and the
> entire site *knows* this and adjusts itself around these few. That
> makes for an interesting scenario, but it detracts from Digg’s purpose
> of finding good links. Month after month, the site’s content gets
> dumber and dumber, though the site keeps growing because it has this
> social momentum. In Digg’s case, the dumber the content it provides,
> the more users it gets, and Digg wants users more than it wants
> intelligence.
>
> Tumblr has this problem as well. When it first launched, one of the
> larger appeals it held was that it was so ultrasimple. Yes, it was
> nice that you could get special formatting for quotes, but I had
> friends sign on and use it like they would use a regular blog, and
> because Tumblr didn’t have elongated datestamping and tagging and
> comments, they got a very clean place to show off their stuff. I’m
> certain that it was while using Tumblr that I first developed an
> aversion to Blogger, because suddenly their themes looked cluttered
> and overbloated. While Tumblr developed a community, it was one that
> you could effectively opt out of if you didn’t care.
>
> Recently, however, Tumblr has canonized this community. New users are
> given popular blogs to follow by default. The emphasis on notes and
> liking and reblogging posts has been stressed: the number of users
> reading your blog is displayed directly on the Dashboard, whereas
> before it was two clicks away and out-of-sight. The problem with that
> is that it has changed the attitude of its users. Before, there was a
> certain unrestrained freedom to how tumblelogs were kept. Now, more
> than ever, there’s a feeling of restraint, of this canon community
> existing, and more and more blogs that I come across are trying to
> cater to this central niche of the site. Whereas before nearly every
> blog I read had its own radically different set of sources - it was
> several months into using the site that I even heard the name
> [Topherchris](http://topherchris.com/) - now, being a part of Tumblr
> means knowing the people who hang together and the various inside
> jokes and the site-specific memes and movements.
>
> While that’s helped Tumblr grow, it killed a part of the site that was
> really valuable: the freedom of the isolation Tumblr started you off
> with, of not knowing anything about the site other than the basic
> functionality. It let you form your own community rather than
> subscribing to a site-wide one.
>
> The problem with social is that it works. Add in elements to your site
> that let users group together with other people and there’ll be a
> surge in activity. The more malicious elements - the closed circle on
> Digg, the feeling of the central group on Tumblr - make certain types
> of users far more rabidly active at the same time as it constructs an
> unhealthy hierarchy. At the same time, however, a site that grows
> overly social ruins its ability to function as an objective tool. I’ve
> been criticized before for writing on Tumblr, for instance, rather
> than a site like Wordpress, because this self-focus on reblogging and
> being part of this inward community means that a lot of blogs here -
> most, even - are incomprehensible unless you’re a part of the Tumblr
> community. The site rewards people who play along with the central
> group with more attention, at the cost of alienating external readers.
> It damages the site’s ability to work as a blog when it encourages
> people to use it as more of a toy and less of a means of isolated
> expression.
>
> To state the concept more generally: social becomes harmful when it
> becomes unavoidable. As soon as users feel actively penalized for not
> interacting with other people, something is lost in the site’s
> functionality.
>
> There are some services that handle their social elements very well.
> Flickr, for instance, has a very extensive set of groups, yet in my
> two years as an occasional member I’ve never felt prompted to get
> involved in their groups. I know where they are, if I’m searching for
> them, but I don’t see the point to doing it myself, and the site
> doesn’t push me. Similarly, I know a lot of people who are actively
> members of the Last.fm social music scene, who join groups and discuss
> things and post photos, but if I don’t want to be social, I don’t have
> to be, and I still get all the functionality that I want with little
> prodding. Last.fm actually does the best job of handling their users
> of any site I’ve ever seen. I’ve found myself actively involving
> myself in the community - voting up photos of musicians I like, once
> sending an album to somebody who said he couldn’t find a copy - not
> out of any prompting but because the opportunities arose in situations
> where I was just idly exploring. You don’t *have* to be social to
> enjoy the site; in fact, you don’t need an account at all to listen to
> custom radio stations or to look up information about artists. That’s
> a major strength that Last.fm’s got, and while I wonder if they could
> get more activity by prompting users to interact more, I love that
> they never do. It makes my use of their site seem much healthier. I
> don’t waste time on Last.fm that I do on a site like Tumblr, where,
> despite efforts to stop, I find myself refreshing often to see if
> there was any activity on my recent writings.
>
> Some sites need a social element. Facebook is all about being social
> with other people. They put in place a lot of systems to stop people
> from getting too overloaded if people want to stop, but their entire
> purpose is being a hub of constant activity. At the same time, they
> differ from a place like MySpace in that your friends and your pages
> are kept separate. I can be a fan of a band and get news from that
> band and still not have that information at all intermingling with my
> discussions with friends. For Facebook, that *is* the utility. For a
> site whose goal isn’t centrally social, too much social can be a bad
> thing. The leaderboards on Reddit and Hacker News, which serve no
> purpose other than fostering a sense of competition, both promote
> sorts of users that really ought not to be promoted. (Hacker News has
> got an incredibly better ratio of good-to-bad, but there are still
> people who submit lots of shitty stories with sensational titles, and
> I think any news-submitting system ought to promote more the people
> who put time and care into what they choose to submit.)
>
> The problem with noise and communities is so extreme that sites exist
> only to aggregate all the social elements - though never, of course,
> in a way so that people on the original site can see the activity. If
> somebody with Friendfeed reblogs me on Tumblr, there might be an
> entire discussion about what I write that I never see, unless of
> course I get an account and start monitoring people, in which case I
> have another social layer on top of everything. That’s malicious. It
> forces people into a system in order to get something out of it.
>
> I doubt it’s possible to construct an easy solution to the problem.
> It’s something that each site individually has to struggle with, and
> very few designers want to take the time. Why bother worrying about
> something that’s bringing you new users? It’s worse because each
> designer places their own community at a greater value than that of
> others. There’s rarely any effort to step out of the limelight, to
> provide a single service that doesn’t try to steamroll other services.
> That’s actually one of the good things about Twitter: while it’s
> certainly an actively social site, and while that leads to a lot of
> things I find annoying, it’s exactly what it intends to be, and it
> doesn’t attempt to grab attention from other sources. There’s an
> integrity to its design in that regard that a lot of sites don’t have.
>
> Designers would do well to remember, however, that being social isn’t
> always necessary or healthy. There’s a downside to social, and it’s
> one that’s too-often ignored. For the sake of making a healthier,
> happier web site, and for the sake of users who are already too
> swamped by what they’ve got, figuring out how to make a site socially
> in a *benevolent* way is a challenge worth taking.
