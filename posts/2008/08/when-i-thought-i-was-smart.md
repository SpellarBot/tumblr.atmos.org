when i thought i was smart
==========================

-   dissent is more valuable than consensus, because it forces you to
    know why you do what you do.
-   comfort is the last state of mind before death. reality is king. 
-   reality can be painful. pain that comes from reality should be given
    attention.
-   small teams rule the universe.
-   consensus/comittee …. death
-   dictatorship … death
-   get out of people’s way
-   focus is king (nobody tell reality about this, there will be a war)
-   don’t waste people’s time
-   non-comformists are necessary. if we do things like everyone else
    does, we limit ourselves to being no better than anyone else.
-   honest failure is valuable
