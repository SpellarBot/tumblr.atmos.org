Two Wolves
==========

Cherokee Chief: A fight is going on inside me. It is a terrible fight
and it is between two wolves. One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow,
regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority,
lies, false pride, superiority, self-doubt, and ego. The other is good -
he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence,
empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. This same fight is
going on inside you - and inside every other person, too. Grandson(after
thinking for a minute): Which wolf will win? Cherokee Chief: The one you
feed.
