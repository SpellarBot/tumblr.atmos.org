A snow leopard cub, one of two born May 11, stands near the entrance to the den, at the Cape May County Zoo in Cape May Court House, N.J. The 2-month-old males had been mostly in seclusion with their mother, Himani, until this past week. The zoo is holding a contest in which children 12 and younger can pick names for the two cubs on the zoo’s website.
