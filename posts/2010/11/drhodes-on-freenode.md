drhodes on freenode
===================

drhodes: It all started when I forked her repository. A clean tree, if
you know what I mean. It screamed README and HACKME. So I checked her
TODO and got busy. Almost immediately she said she wanted to branch, and
I was like hold on! hold on! And she said, “it’s ok hun - this isnt
svn”. drhodes: I asked her “what’s the diff” and before I knew it I was
pulling, she was pushing, back and forth all night until we merged back
at her place. That’s when I knew, this one wasn’t like the others, it
was all going so fast and I wasn’t worried about losing anything.
