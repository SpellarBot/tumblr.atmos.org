As we’re all aware by now, one of the worst environmental disasters in recorded history is underway in the Gulf.
As helpless as you may feel, you can do something right now by donating to a Gulf protection group like Save Our Gulf, the National Audubon Society, or the Greater New Orleans Foundation.
To get all of you involved this week, we’re replacing Tumblr’s usual ocean blue with a new heart-of-BP-executive black and letting you donate without leaving your Dashboard.
Donating will also unlock the Limited Edition Black Dashboard as an account preference.
